<br/>

**GOAL:**  

Using segmentation, find out why the sales in the game are not as great as they could be.  

**TASKS:**

1. Determine the dynamics of sales by segments "Russia" / "Not Russia".
2. Find out if the monthly Retention of users in Russia differs from the Retention of users from other countries.
3. Select core-players and see how their monthly income differs from the income from regular players.


**the core-player definition includes clients with the following parameters:*
- *made a purchase in the amount of more than 1200 rub,*
- *the average time between consecutive purchases does not exceed 28 days,*
- *made at least one purchase in the last two months*

**CONCLUSIONS:**  

Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the return rate for non-Russian users is better, while the return of users from Russia has been falling for the last 3 months. And since more than 90% of users are from Russia, it is recommended to focus on increasing the Retention metric, since even with a large increase in the indicators of the “Not Russia” segment, overall sales of the product will fall.  
It can also be seen that most of the revenue was generated by users from the non-core player segment, and therefore it is necessary to develop a strategy to attract customers to the core player segment.
